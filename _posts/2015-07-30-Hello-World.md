### "Hello World!"

This is the first post on this space, as there isn't much here yet I will send you over to the [About]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/) to learn a little more about me. This blog is hosted on [Github Pages](pages.github.com), the domain is bought from [NameCheap](namecheap.com), the page is optimized with [CloudFlare](cloudflare.com)'s DNS services. The content is created in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and compiled using [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com). This project is hosted [here](github.com/VDKA/blog). Any questions, just ask.
