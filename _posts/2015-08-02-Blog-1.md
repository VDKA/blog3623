title: What is Information Architecture? (Blog 1)
---

### 1. What is information? Describe the qualities of information.
Information is any data that has some form of meaning. This meaning is often
relavent within a particular context. Information can be classified into
groups. It can be observed, recorded, measured and analysed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. What is the Dewey Decimal System? Describe how it operates.
The Dewey Decimal System is a method of classification for literature pieces.
First published in 1876, this system is used by many libraries around the
world. The Dewey Decimal System can be seen as a tree of sorts, with the root
of the tree consisting of _ten classes_ (broad topics such as _History_).
Within each class there are up to _ten divisions_ and these are more specific.
For example _Modern History_ or _12th Century_. Further, each division
contains _ten sections_.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Explain what Library Science is.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. What is information architecture?
Information architecture is the practice of structuring the information you
manage, such as _books_ or _merchandise listings_, in a manner that is
accessible to users. This often means laying out the information you have in a
manner that the user may be familiar with or is intuitive for the user to learn
understand.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. List and describe at least three reasons for why information architecture is important.
Information architecture is important as it can:
 * ...help reduce user bounce rate, that is the percentage of users to your
_website_ who navigate away from your site after viewing a single page. An
improvement in this number will see your customers reaching the places you
want them to at a greater rate providing improved revenue to your buisness.
Also applicable in the context of a non-profit where your trade is providing
users with a service, the users accessing the service will see an increase as
a result of better information architecture.
 * ...help improve user reception of your brand. A company that provides a
service that is difficult to access will leave customers unsatisfied. This may
result in them leaving a bad review, leaving a negative image for your
buisness and the service you provide.
 * ...help to reduce the complexity of the front facing interface. This is
beneficial as an interface with less complexity is easier to create, easier to
manage and to maintain. Less complexity in an interface also reduces the
difficulty one might experiance learning to use it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. List and describe the four key information architecture concepts that help information architects articulate user needs and behaviours.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7. List and describe the three main information architecture systems that support a web site.
 * __Searching Systems__ provide a way to quickly search an index of your site
for a set of terms known as a query. Search systems are a direct way for the
user to get to where they want to be.
 * __Navigation Systems__ are systems that allows a user to explore the site.
 The user may not know what they are looking for, but navigation systems
should show the user what is available on your site.
 * __Semantic Networks__ are other systems that allow the user to explore
your site. They exist as a set of terms that may describe a concept or theme.
These are often known as tags, tags can have relationships with other tags for
example, a listing on a sales website may be tagged _vehicle_ this listing may
be related to another listing tagged _vehicle accessory_ that may be of
interest to the user. An example of a semantic network in use would be
amazon's listing system, it suggests listing related to the listing the user
is currently viewing. This type of system can increase revenue by directing
users to things they may not yet know they are looking for. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8. List and describe the four main information architecture deliverables.
 * __Wireframes__ are a sort of mockup of a IA deliverable, such as a
 website. They may look like this: 

![Mockup Example Image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wireframeExample.svg "Wireframe")

 * __Blueprints__ are a way to design the architecture of a website. They can
 give you a sort of *birds eye view* of your website.
 * __Controlled Vocabularies__ are a delivarable that provide a set of terms 
 that can be used to improve a pages search ability. 
 * __Metadata Schema__ is used to define properties of webpages and content
 to make a page more dicoverable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9. TODO

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 10. Check out the [IA Institute](http://iainstitute.org/). What sort of value do you see such and institute being to the community?
Institutes such as this one can be valuable for providing guidance. This
guidance can take the form of 
 * Mentoring
 * Support
 * Encouragement
 * Networking
These can all be valuable to people starting out in information architecture
and for people who wish to seek advice in a central place.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 11. Describe what is meant by the term *information ecology*?
The word ecology is defined as:

> The branch biology that deals with the relations of organisms to one another and their physical surroundings.

As such the term information ecology relates to it's individual parts, 
*content, context, and users* and how these relate to one another.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 12. What is content management and how does it relate to information architecture?
Content management is a:

>...process for collecting, managing, and publishing content to any outlet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 13. What is metadata and how is it used in IA?
Metadata is a set of data that describes and gives information about other
data. In IA it is used to organise content to improve discoverability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 14. Explain why the *Too-Simple* information model is unrealistic for modelling users' information seeking behaviours.
The *too-simple* approach falls short when users do not know what they are
searching for or how to express it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 15. Describe how a web site user typically finds information.
Well as a web site user I can say how I typically find information. Typically
if a web site has a search function, I use it. It does not matter if I know
what I know what I am looking for or not. An example is if I knew I wanted a 
air of speakers I might search Amazon for speakers and get an idea of what is
around. If I were to know an exact model of speaker I was after I would simply 
search for the model number.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 16. What is known-item seeking?
Known-item seeking occurs when a user knows exactly what they want. 

* There is a model of speaker I want to purchase and I know what it is called so I navigate directly to it.
* A phone number for *John Johnson*.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 17. What is exploratory seeking?
Exploratory seeking occurs when a user is trying to learn about a topic. 

* I want to purchase some speakers however, I do not know what I want exactly.
* Researching about different dog breeds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 18. What is exhaustive research?
Exhaustive research occurs when a user wants to know everything about something.

* I want to know the absolute best pair of speakers to buy for under $100.
* I want to know about every unit available for rent in South Brisbane.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 19. What is re-finding?
Re-finding occurs when a user wants to find something they have seen before.

* I remember seeing a pair of speakers two days ago. Now I want them.
* I told my friend Ann about an article I was reading I wonder if I can find it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 20. What is the Berry Picking Model?
The berry picking model is often used when you don't know what the right
question is or you don't know how to ask it. It involves making an often vague
or broad request for information and gradually picking parts that are useful 
and adapting your request.

1. I perform a search on a real-estate site for houses in South Brisbane.
2. I look and find many are out of my price range so I add a price range to my search.
3. I need at least two bedrooms and a car space so I add this limitation to my search.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 21. What is the Pearl Growing Model?
The pearl growing model involves beginning with a couple of documents that are
exactly what you want and searching for items that are alike.

1. I found a really nice picture of a car and I want to find similar ones.
2. I use the original image on google images to find similar images.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 22. Explain what search analytics are and how they help you learn more about information needs and seeking behaviours.
Search Analytics are used to review some of the most common search queries on
your product and diagnose problems with the performance of those searches. They
can also be used to identify and improve issues in navigation, metadata and
content. This is possible because search analytics allow you too see what 
people are searching and whether they are getting the results they should be.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 23. Explain what contextual enquiry is and how it helps you learn more about information needs and seeking behaviours.
Contextual Inquiry is used gain an insight into how users are interacting with
your website and why they are interacting in the way they are.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 24. Use the pearl growing method for information seeking to search for information about *Electronic Record and Documents Management* and *Digital Asset Management*.

#### a. Describe what you found/learnt about *Electronic Record and Documents Management*

Electronic Document and Records Management Systems (EDRMS) aims to help 
organisations manage files, records and documents throughout the life of the 
documents. EDRMS are automated software applications. They may also automate 
other buisness workflows such as approvals and intergrations. They may help
buisnesses move to a paperless environment, making document management an
automated process rather then a part of someones job.

Digital Asset Management (DAM) is a set of management tasks and decisions
surrounding the use, retrieval, access, labeling, storage and distribution of
digital assets. Images, animations, videos and music are a typical example of
digital asset management. These fall into a sub catagory known as Media Asset
Management.

Both systems can involve valuable integrations which can add features such as:

* Verstion control and revision management
* Search through tagging systems
* Access restriction, through access levels.
* Redundancy through automated backups
* Automatic retention and disposal of documents or files

These kinds of systems can have huge costs associated with them. For instance
one search revealed some software called [AssetBank](https://www.assetbank.co.uk)
running a $7500 fee for a one of licence or $470 per month to rent it's
services. Pricing like this makes many management systems out of reach of
independant users. 

However independant users 

#### b. Describe your experience with using the pearl growing method and the processes you undertook.
Well the pearl growing method typically involves a user roughly what they want.
But I didn't want to be spending my time searching for Asset management systems
with a vague sense of purpose. The more information I found on these systems 
the more it sounded like they were just more scalable versions of the file
systems you have on your everyday Mac or PC with more integrations included.
I feel the kinds of things these systems are doing could be implemented with a
few shell scripts set up to run as a job every day. For example one example of
behaviour for an EDRMS was the automatted handling of disposal for a document 
upon reaching the end of it's lifecycle. Now, for example a law firm may wish 
to retain documents for 5 years after their associated case is marked as
completed. This behaviour could be done by having a company file directory in
which there is a completed cases folder which a script runs over every
day/month/year removing any file that has been in the directory for the 5 
years. This kind of behaviour isn't anything fancy and could be managed by an 
IT department for a __lot__ less then $470 a month. As the IT department can
write the script and simply maintain it in house. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wow. 2000 words. That means I have written more for this one week of assesment
worth 3% of my grade then my law student girlfriend had to write for an
assignment worth 15% which she had 3 weeks to do. I spent 10+ hours on this. 
Oh how I wish I was in the new engineering degree where this course is not
required.
