### 1. What is a Content Management System? Why might you use a CMS?

### 3. What is an open source CMS?
An open source CMS is just a CMS that is open source. That is its source code 
is openly available. Users are permitted to view and modify the source as they
see fit. Users may wish to add additional features, improve existing features 
or fix bugs they find. This can all be done and when the user has made their
changes or improvements they can contribute the change to the main project.

### 9. Design a website about something. Describe the audience and design choices.

For this question I have created a blog/learning style site titled __Swiftling__. This site will aim to provide the audience with any knowledge they need to get starting using the Swift programming language for development. The website will provide resources with which people can access to assist in their learning as well as articles relating to swift projects underway.

The target audience will be:

* of either Gender
* of any (coding capable) age
* of any demographic and socio-economic background

Coding is for anybody who is interested. The only factor in question here is the socio-economic background involving all as swift is currently an Apple centric language. This would exclude many low income readers. However it will only remain this way until the end of this year when swift will gain support for Linux allowing everyone to make use of the language.

As the audience is broad, the site design will be a generic and simple design with minimal UI bling. By keeping page sizes small (using less assets), the content will be far more accessible to people with internet data access as a limiting factor ie. developing nations. It will also draw a focus to the content itself. Any advertising to be done on a site like this should come in the form of textual ads as these draw the least attention from the content the site is there for.
