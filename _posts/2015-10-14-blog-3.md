### 1. Why is it difficult for people to reward good IA?
Good IA goes un-noticed this is intentional. When there is minimal frictin between the user and what the user is doing is when IA is working best.

---

### 2. Explain what is meant by "Top-Down IA"?
Top down IA focuses on directing the user through the app by guiding them from the "Top" to the "Bottom" that is the user begins navigation by specifying something they want in broad terms and works to narrow it down.

### 3. What are some common questions a user has upon langing on a page on a web site?

* Where can I go?
* What can I see?

---

### 4. What is meant by "Bottom up IA" and why is it becoming more important?
Bottom up IA refers to the practice of piecing together components of a system to create an improved navigation system. A short example may be a blog with posts that are each given a set of tags. You can browse these tags manually or a system can be built upon these tags that let you search and filter posts by tags and terms.

---

### 5. What is an organization system?
An organization system is just a way to manage content through categorization. Examples are not limited to the IT field, organization systems are seen in libraries, stores and even cities. The methods are often different depending on what is being organized. For example to organize a blog you might tag posts according to their subject. But to organize a city you would mark regions known as districts as being Industrial, Residential, Commercial or some Hybrid.

### 6. What is a site-wide navigation system?
A site-wide navigation system is exactly what the name conveys, a navigation system that is seen on all pages of the site. Often these are navigation bars or sidebars.

### 35. Arrange the following list in alphabetical order.
Sorted order as done by the UNIX sort function. This sort uses the following rules:

* lines starting with a number will appear before lines starting with a letter;
* lines starting with a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet will appear before lines starting with a letter that appears later in the alphabet;
* lines starting with a lowercase letter will appear before lines starting with the same letter in uppercase.

My Sorted List

    #!%&: Creating Comic Books
    $35 a Day Through Europe
    .38 Special
    1001 Arabian Nights
    Albany, New York
    El Paso, Texas
    H20: The Beauty of Water
    New York, New York
    Newark, New Jersey
    Plzen, Czech Republic
    Saint Nicholas, Belgium
    St. Louis, Missouri
    The 1-2-3 of Magic
    The Hague, Netherlands
    The Lord of the Rings
    XVIIme si√®cle

Questions

* "The Hague" starts with T this is a logical alphabetical sort, therefore it is sorted under T.
* "El Paso" starts with E, is sorted under E.
* "New York" came before "Newark" as special characters such as space are sorted before digits and numbers.
* Again, logical sort.
* Punctuation is sorted before numbers which are sorted before letters. This is arbitrary and could be done any way we want. In fact the question asked for alphabetically and did not specify which direction, we could flip the search and still satisfy the constraints of the question.
* Italicized terms are book titles? OK, so separate them from the list as we now know italicized items are a special case. 
* Chronology would require more information. If each term came with associated dates then and only then they could be sorted chronologically. However the question contains a fault, as it assumes there is something meaningful to a list of two items that have zero relation.
