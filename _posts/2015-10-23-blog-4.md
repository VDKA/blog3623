### 2. What is the processes involved for creating a web site using HTML and uploading the site to a web server?
In order to create a web site using HTML that is accessible on the web you must:

* Acquire a domain name, providers such as _namecheap_ often provide domains for as little as $1. There are also a number of free options but these often involve your domain name being a subdomain of a larger site. eg. `mysite.wix.com`
* Hosting
    * Establish a static IP address and enable port forwarding to a local server or 
    * Use a dynamicDNS service to automatically link your IP address to your domain as your IP changes or
    * Acquire a hosting service.
    * This website for example is hosted for free at `github.com` using their pages service.
* Creating the website.
    - You need to create the HTML file that holds the content of your site.
    - To style this content you need to create a CSS file and import it into your HTML.
    - To make your content interactive you need to write scripts in Javascript.

### 3. Contrast the differences between creating a web site using HTML and using a CMS.
Using a CMS you will typically be guided through a well established installation method, pick a template for your content and set up domain names and you are good to go. No coding needed.

Using HTML you must write actual code to create a page in the style you want, determine a way to host this code, and again set up domain names.

The difference is a CMS can provide a process of doing this, be it a guide through a settings page or a set up process, you will be walked through and have your hand held the whole way. However with HTML you are left alone in the cold with a empty text editor and if your lucky some know how.
