### 1. Describe what Google Analytics is, the functionality it provides, and how it might be useful when designing/maintaining a website.
_Google Analytics_ is a service that Google provides via a script you can include on your website. This script enables a site owner to record a range of data, including:

* Various demographic details
* The users:
    - Browser
    - Operating System
    - ISP
* Page views
* Pages viewed per session
* Number of unique visitors
* Average sessions duration
* User return rates
* User _Flow_ (pages viewed in order)

These sort of statistics can be invaluable when maintaining a website as they allow the creator to gain valuable insights into their viewer ship allowing them to better cater the page to this target demographic or potentially expand into others.
