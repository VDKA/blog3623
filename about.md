I am currently a student studying a bachelour of Engineering Major in Software at Griffith University in Brisbane, Queesnland. I expect to graduate second semester 2016. When I do I would love to find a position that offers me a learning environment where I can surround my self with some of the best in the industry and learn by doing. I would love to go into the mobile development sector of my field, since starting mobile development I have enjoyed every moment and found myself creating small passion projects just to write a few lines of code.

### Things I Enjoy

* Coding solutions to problems, normally problems I create for myself occasionally not.
* Coding fun little tidbits for educational purposes.
* Learning about almost anything.
* Having ~40 Google Chrome tabs open 24/7. (I actually hate this).
* Productivity hacking. (Occassionally productivly).
* Dabbing my toes in the foreign exchange markets.

### Things I am Working on

Optimally everything I am working on would be hosted on github so I could say look there but it isn't. At the time of writing this I am working on two iOS apps, one for a client and one to both learn something new and to do something with what I learn.

I am working on setting up this website at the moment. I purchased the domain in order to force myself to work on it. I want a site that I can put down on my resume that can link to my work and be more captivating and interactive then a paper resume. It also is a great opportunity to learn to use some new tools and frameworks.

## About This Blog

I am starting this blog as part of the Information and Content Management Course ([3623ICT](https://degrees.griffith.edu.au/Course/3623ICT)). More about that later. This is my first blog for self created content. While I have started it for this course, I would like to continue to work on it using it to collect my thoughts, detail my endevours and create a sort of personal space where I can detail things I find interesting.

### About The Course

I believe this course will help me learn new ways that small and large scale buisnesses, governments, assosiations and individuals are managing their content. Along with this I would hope to learn some _best practice_ techniques when dealing with this field. I would also like to leave with the knowledge of optimizing a page or content for discovery. 

There are a couple of people in the course that I have worked with before, however I am happy to work on the blog on my own.
